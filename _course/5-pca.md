# Lecture 

## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should understand what is principal components analysis and how to apply it to our spatial transcriptomic datasets.

---

# Hands-on Component 

Our in-class hands-on component will involve analyzing our spatial transcriptomics dataset using principal components analysis to create a data visualization.

We will also begin making multi-panel visualizations.
