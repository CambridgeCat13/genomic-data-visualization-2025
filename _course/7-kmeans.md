# Lecture

## Lesson learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should understand what is kmeans clustering and how to apply it to our spatial transcriptomic datasets.

---

# Hands-on Component

Our in-class hands-on component will analyze our spatial transcriptomics datasets to create a data visualization using k-means clustering.

# Homework Assignment

Make another student’s data visualization from the 'opposite team' using your spatial transcriptomics data. Does your visualization make salient the same points from the original data visualization? Why or why not?
