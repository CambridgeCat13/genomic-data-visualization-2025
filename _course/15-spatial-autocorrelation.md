# Lecture

## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, we should be able to understand how to identify spatially variable genes in our data using Moran's I. We will also be able to use interactive data visualizations to get some sense for the quality of our analysis.

# Hands-on Component

Our in-class hands-on component will involve calculating Moran's I.
