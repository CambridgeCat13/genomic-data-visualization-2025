# What data types are you visualizing?
The data visualized represents the spatial distribution of MS4A1 expression. This is a gene encoding CD20, a well-known surface marker expressed on B-cells, which are a critical part of the adaptive immune system. The dataset originates from a spatial transcriptomics experiment and includes both spatial coordinates of cells and their respective gene expression levels. The data has been normalized using Counts Per Million (CPM) and transformed with log10(x + 1) scaling to account for cells with no measurable expression. Expression values range from 0 (no expression) to 5 (high expression) in the log10 scale.

# What data encodings (geometric primitives and visual channels) are you using to visualize these data types?
To represent individual cells in the tissue, I used points as geometric primitives.
Each point represents a single cell. The following visual channels encode the data:

Position (x, y): These encode the spatial location of each cell within the tissue.

Color (hue): This encodes the expression level of MS4A1 on a per-cell basis. A gradient is applied, where higher expression levels are shown in warm colors (yellow, orange, red), and cells without measurable expression are blue.

This encoding leverages pre-attentive processing principles, as viewers can easily identify and differentiate high-expression cells by their warm hues.

# What about the data are you trying to make salient through this data visualization?
The visualization highlights a key biological trend: MS4A1 expression (and by extension, B-cells) is localized to a specific region, suggesting a potential lymphoid aggregation. Such clusters may indicate immune activity, often
associated with tissue damage, inflammation, or tumor microenvironments.

# What Gestalt principles and/or knowledge about perceptiveness of visual encodings are you using to accomplish this?
To make this trend salient, I applied these Gestalt principles:

1. Similarity: Cells are colored based on expression levels, with warm colors representing B-cells and blue representing other cells. This differentiation emphasizes the grouping of B-cells.

2. Proximity: The spatial distribution of points naturally reveals areas where cells are clustered, reinforcing the localized nature of MS4A1 expression.

These principles guide viewers to perceive the pattern of B-cell clustering and their spatial relationship to other cells in the tissue.

# Create dataframe
df <- data.frame(x=pos[,1], y=pos[,2], gene = normgexp[,g])

# Plot dataframe
