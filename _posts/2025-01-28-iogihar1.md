### 1. What data types are you visualizing?
Spatial and categorical data of gene for each cell. Location of each cell is represented by x and y coordinates of a dot. Each dot is color coded by the name of the gene with the highest count in that given cell. 

### 2. What data encodings (geometric primitives and visual channels) are you using to visualize these data types?
Used the points as geometric primitive for each cell positioned by x and y coordinates. Then used color to encode the gene with the highest count in each cell.
In addition, I used the size of the dot to encode the count of the gene with the highest count in each cell.

### 3. What about the data are you trying to make salient through this data visualization? 
The plot is intended to show the spatial distribution of the gene with the highest count in each cell. The size of the dot is used to show the "expressiveness" of the gene in each cell assuming that the gene with the highest count is the most expressive gene in that cell. 

### 4. What Gestalt principles or knowledge about perceptiveness of visual encodings are you using to accomplish this?
Similarity: The same gene is represented by the same color across the cells. Also the proximity of the dots to each other shows the spatial distribution of the gene across the cells. 

### 5. Code (paste your code in between the ``` symbols)

```r
file <- '~/Desktop/genomic-data-visualization-2025/data/pikachu.csv.gz'
data <- read.csv(file, row.names=1)

library(ggplot2)

df <- data[,7:ncol(data)]
# Find column names of max values for each row
max_col_names <- colnames(df)[apply(df, 1, which.max)]
# Find the max value for each row
max_values <- apply(df, 1, max)
# plot the data
ggplot(data) + geom_point(aes(x=aligned_x, y=aligned_y, color=max_col_names), size=max_values/25) + theme(aspect.ratio=1.0) + ggtitle("Scatter plot: color codes by max value gene")

```
