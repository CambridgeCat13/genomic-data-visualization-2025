**Visualization Summary**
In this visualization, I analyzed a cluster within the Pikachu dataset responsible for cell growth, and likely cancer. This was a major change from the Eevee sequencing dataset where the top 1000 genes were used in analysis. In the Imaging-based Pikachu dataset, there were 319 genes. All of the genes in the dataset were normalized, log-transformed, and clustered (K = 4). The ideal K was determined through plotting the total-withiness scores for K = [1, 10]. Then, based on the elbow method heuristic, the optimal number of clusters was determined to be 4 (see code for the plot). To understand gene expression similarity profiles and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, principal component analysis was performed (A). Cluster 4 was chosen and was spatially analyzed (B). Next, differential gene expression analysis was performed to display the statistical significant of changes in gene expression between cluster 4 and other clusters which ultimately highlights genes with large expression differences (C). The top 20 genes in cluster 4 were then displayed, and **PDGFRB** was chosen as the gene of interest due to its expression level (D). t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) analysis was then performed on PDGFRB gene expression to better visualize its expression across cells (E), and spatial analysis was also performed (F).

I am confident in my assessment that cluster 4 contains cell type responsible for cell growth in Breast Cancer due to high expression of PDGFRB [1]. Additionally, MMP2 which was second most differentially expressed gene also plays a critical role in breast tumor invasion and metastasis [2]. Specifically, the overlap between the spatial distribution of PDGFRB (Fig. F) aligns with the spatial distribution of cells in cluster 4 (Fig. B) so I am confident in my characterization of the cell-type of breast cancer cells with a growth mutation. My original analysis of the Eevee dataset identified MMP11 as the gene of interest and a cell type of breast cancer cells. While there were flaws in the original analysis, specifically with identifying the gene of interest (error caused by using a very high K, so the gene was not unique to the cluster and was likely highly expressed throughout the dataset), the cell type identified in both clusters is similar. Due to the difference between the two datasets, many of the genes analyzed in the Eevee dataset, including MMP11, were not present in the Pikachu dataset.
