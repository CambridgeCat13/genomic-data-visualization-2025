## Description of Changes from HW3 to HW4 and Justification

In HW3, I initially selected GJB2 as my gene of interest, assuming it marked an epithelial cell population. However, my differential expression analysis revealed that GJB2 was actually downregulated in the selected cluster, meaning that my original conclusion in HW3—that the cluster represented an epithelial population—was incorrect. Instead, my volcano plot analysis revealed that CD79A, CD19, and MZB1 were the most upregulated genes, all of which are
known B cell markers. This suggests that the cluster I originally analyzed in HW3 was actually a B cell population, not an epithelial one. To correct this, I changed my focus to CD79A, allowing me to properly track the same immune cell population between datasets in HW4.

I switched from the Pikachu dataset in HW3 to the Eevee dataset in HW4. The datasets differ significantly in the number of genes and cells – Pikachu has about 17,000 cells and 300 genes, while Eevee has about 700 cells and 18,000 genes. I adjusted my code to change which columns I extracted data from. I also performed k-means clustering with a different k value. In HW3, I used k = 5 in Pikachu. In HW4, for Eevee the elbow plot suggests that using k = 4 is more optimal, based on the total within-cluster sum of squares. This decrease in k makes sense because Eevee (spot-based) has far fewer cells than Pikachu (single-cell resolution), meaning there are naturally fewer distinct groups of cells to separate.

To select the cluster of interest, I computed the mean expression of CD79A across clusters and chose the one with the highest expression. This was Cluster 3, which exhibited significant upregulation of CD79A (logFC = 1.01, adj p-value = 7.75e-14), supporting the hypothesis that this cluster represents a B cell population. In HW3, my B cell cluster also showed strong upregulation of CD19, suggesting that it represents the same immune cell population, so I examined its mean expression in the cluster and confirmed that it is also upregulated. Additionally, one of the top upregulated genes in the cluster was FCRL4, a well-known marker for memory B cells, further reinforcing the presence of B cells in this cluster and aligning with the hypothesis that this cluster corresponds to the same cell type across datasets.

However, some of the other highly upregulated genes in Cluster 3, such as PNLIP (a pancreatic enzyme) and KLHL40 (a muscle-related protein), do not directly align with known B cell markers. This suggests that Cluster 3 may contain a mixed population of cells or activated B cells in a distinct functional state.

Despite this, the combination of CD79A and FCRL4 expression strongly suggests that Cluster 3 contains B cells, potentially memory or regulatory B cells. Comparing this cluster’s transcriptional profile to the Pikachu dataset provides evidence that the same immune cell population is present in both datasets.
