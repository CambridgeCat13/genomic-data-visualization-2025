### 1. Write a description explaining why you believe your data visualization is effective using vocabulary terms from Lesson 1. 

The figure I created presents an analysis of cell clustering and gene expression patterns using both dimensionality reduction techniques and spatial visualization. The scree plot (a) demonstrates that the first few principal components capture most of the variance, justifying the use of PCA and t-SNE for clustering. PCA (b) reveals distinct transcriptional clusters, with the olive-colored cluster appearing as a unique population. t-SNE (c) further refines this distinction by preserving local relationships, confirming that the olive cluster is not an artifact of linear variance but rather a biologically distinct group. The physical space clustering (d) shows that this cluster is not randomly distributed but instead occupies specific regions within the tissue, suggesting an organized spatial structure. The expression of ERBB2 (e) in PCA space highlights that this gene is predominantly upregulated in a specific population, aligning with the olive cluster. Similarly, the t-SNE visualization of EGFR expression (f) shows a matching pattern, reinforcing the co-expression of these genes. In the physical space plots (g, h), EGFR expression is localized and non-random, further supporting the hypothesis that the olive cluster corresponds to a distinct epithelial cell population. The strong co-expression of ERBB2 and EGFR, both in reduced and physical space, suggests that this cluster represents luminal epithelial cells, particularly those involved in active growth and signaling. These genes are hallmark markers of epithelial cell identity and proliferation, with established roles in tissue development, repair, and oncogenic transformation. Given their spatial localization and transcriptional profile, the olive cluster is likely composed of epithelial cells engaged in growth factor signaling, potentially representing a proliferative niche within the tissue.

To further validate this interpretation, I examined other genes known to co-express with ERBB2 and EGFR in epithelial cell populations. CDH1 (E-cadherin) and FOXA1, both critical regulators of epithelial identity and differentiation, showed similar spatial and transcriptional distributions. CDH1 is essential for maintaining cell-cell adhesion in epithelial tissues, while FOXA1 is a key transcription factor governing luminal epithelial lineage commitment. Their overlapping expression with ERBB2 and EGFR strengthens the hypothesis that the olive cluster represents luminal epithelial cells with an active role in tissue maintenance or regeneration. This co-expression pattern aligns with previous findings on epithelial lineage specification in glandular tissues, particularly in breast and lung epithelium, where ERBB2, EGFR, and FOXA1 interact to regulate cell fate (Jozwik & Carroll, 2012, Nat Rev Cancer DOI: 10.1038/nrc3262; van Roy & Berx, 2008, Cell Mol Life Sci DOI: 10.1007/s00018-008-8281-1).
