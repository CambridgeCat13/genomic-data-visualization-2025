### Description 

The figure above presents an analysis of a specific cluster of interest identified from single-cell gene expression data. The top-left panel shows the cluster in tSNE space, where the selected cluster (blue points) is clearly distinguishable from the rest (gray points), suggesting that these cells share a common expression profile. The top-right panel depicts the spatial arrangement of the same cluster in physical space, showing that these cells are distributed in a structured manner within the sample.

The middle panel displays the top 20 differentially expressed genes within the cluster. The genes are ranked by log fold change, indicating the most distinct markers for this group. These expression patterns provide insight into the potential identity and function of the cluster.

The bottom-left panel maps the expression of GRB7, a gene known to be co-amplified with HER2 in certain cancers (Tanner et al., 1995), in tSNE space. The bottom-right panel shows the spatial expression of GRB7, revealing that the highest-expressing cells are concentrated in specific regions. This supports the hypothesis that the cluster of interest may represent HER2-positive breast cancer cells, as GRB7 overexpression is frequently associated with aggressive tumor subtypes (Ramsey et al., 2011). In my code, I looked for a cluster that expressed both of these genes, and both of them were heavily expressed in cluster 3. 

Overall, the distinct separation in gene expression space, combined with the high expression of GRB7 and its spatial distribution, strongly suggests that this cluster may correspond to HER2-positive cancer cells. If I had more time, this is something I would explore further with visualizations.
