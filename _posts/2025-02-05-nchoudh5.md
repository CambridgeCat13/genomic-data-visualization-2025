### 1. What data types are you visualizing?
I am visualizing quantitative data for gene expression statistics. Specifically,
I compare gene mean expression and variance (log-transformed) against PC1 loading
values from PCA. Additionally, I'm visualizing categorical data (scaled vs. unscaled PCA),
distinguishing them by color.

### 2. What data encodings (geometric primitives and visual channels) are you using to visualize these data types?
I am using the geometric primitive of points to represent each cell.Position on the x-axis 
encodes log-transformed gene expression mean (left) and variance (right), 
while position on the y-axis encodes PC1 loading values. Hue (red for scaled, 
blue for unscaled) differentiates PCA approaches. Text labels highlight outlier 
genes with extreme PC1 loadings. I also use saturation to declutter points and make it 
easier to see the overall trends in the data. 

### 3. What about the data are you trying to make salient through this data visualization? 
This visualization highlights the relationship between gene expression properties (mean and variance) 
and their influence on the first principal component (PC1) in PCA. Specifically, 
it examines whether highly expressed or highly variable genes contribute more to 
PC1 and how this relationship changes when the data is scaled. By distinguishing 
between scaled and unscaled PCA, it makes salient how PCA behaves differently when 
expression values are standardized. Additionally, outlier genes with extreme PC1 
loadings are labeled, drawing attention to genes that disproportionately drive 
transcriptional variation. 

### 4. What Gestalt principles or knowledge about perceptiveness of visual encodings are you using to accomplish this?
Similarity is used by using color (red for scaled, blue for unscaled) to group 
data points based on their transformation method, making it easy to compare the 
effects of scaling. Proximity is used to group data points with 
similar PC1 loading values, reinforcing the clustering of most genes near zero 
while highlighting outliers.

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

# Load dataset
file <- 'eevee.csv.gz'
data <- read.csv(file)

# Extract gene expression matrix
gexp <- data[, 7:ncol(data)]
rownames(gexp) <- data$barcode

# Select top 1000 highly expressed genes
topgenes <- names(sort(colSums(gexp), decreasing = TRUE)[1:1000])
gexpsub <- gexp[, topgenes]

# Compute mean and variance of each gene
gene_means <- colMeans(gexpsub)
gene_vars <- apply(gexpsub, 2, var)

# Perform PCA without scaling
pcs_unscaled <- prcomp(gexpsub, scale = FALSE)
pc1_loadings_unscaled <- pcs_unscaled$rotation[, 1]

# Perform PCA with scaling
pcs_scaled <- prcomp(gexpsub, scale = TRUE)
pc1_loadings_scaled <- pcs_scaled$rotation[, 1]

# Create data frames for plotting (apply log transformation to mean & variance)
df_unscaled <- data.frame(
  mean = log10(gene_means + 1),  
  variance = log10(gene_vars + 1),  
  loading = pc1_loadings_unscaled,
  Type = "Unscaled",
  Gene = names(gene_means)
)

df_scaled <- data.frame(
  mean = log10(gene_means + 1),
  variance = log10(gene_vars + 1),
  loading = pc1_loadings_scaled,
  Type = "Scaled",
  Gene = names(gene_means)
)

df_combined <- rbind(df_unscaled, df_scaled)

# Filter for genes with PC1 loading less than -0.1
df_combined$label <- ifelse(df_combined$loading < -0.1, df_combined$Gene, NA)

# Panel 1: PC1 Loadings vs. Log-Transformed Gene Mean Expression
p1 <- ggplot(df_combined, aes(x = mean, y = loading, color = Type)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_text(aes(label = label), na.rm = TRUE, size = 3, hjust = 1.2, vjust = 0.5) +  # Move label left

  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "PC1 Loadings vs. Log Gene Mean Expression",
       x = "Log10(Mean Expression + 1)", y = "PC1 Loading Value")

# Panel 2: PC1 Loadings vs. Log-Transformed Gene Variance
p2 <- ggplot(df_combined, aes(x = variance, y = loading, color = Type)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_text(aes(label = label), na.rm = TRUE, size = 3, hjust = 1.2, vjust = 0.5) +  # Move label left

  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "PC1 Loadings vs. Log Gene Variance",
       x = "Log10(Variance + 1)", y = "PC1 Loading Value")

# Combine plots using patchwork
final_plot <- p1 | p2
print(final_plot)
