### Description 

I believe I identified the same cell type, 'CDH1,' in the eevee dataset as I had identified in the pikachu dataset. By detecting the specific cluster in which CDH1 was present, I determined it localized to cluster 1. I then examined the spatial distribution of CDH1 expression within the cell and confirmed its upregulation compared to other cells in the diagram. To further validate this, I used PCA to determine the cluster with the highest CDH1 expression and pinpoint the cellular regions where the expression was most prominent. These analyses supported my earlier findings, confirming that CDH1 was present in the dataset.

One of the adjustments I made during the analysis involved re-evaluating the number of clusters. Initially, the Pikachu dataset, analyzed using the elbow method, yielded 5 clusters. However, in this dataset, 7 clusters proved to be more appropriate. I believe the additional clusters were necessary due to the increased complexity of the dataset, likely reflecting greater cellular heterogeneity or more distinct subpopulations with subtle variations in gene expression that were not captured by fewer clusters. Another change I had to implement was modifying plot 3. The original version of the plot did not effectively highlight the upregulation or downregulation of all genes or provide clear identification of which specific genes were upregulated or downregulated. In the updated volcano plot, I ensured that the distribution of gene expression across all genes was clearly visible, with genes of interest—such as CDH1—marked directly on the plot. This adjustment was particularly crucial for comprehending where and if CDH1 was significantly upregulated compared to other genes, as it allowed me to easily pinpoint its position within the distribution and assess its relative expression levels.
