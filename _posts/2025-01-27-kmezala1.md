# Homework 1

### 1. What data types are you visualizing?
I am visualizing quantitative data of the brightness level of CD3D and PRF1 genes (2 quantitative variables) for each cell. Also, I am showing spatial data regarding the x,y centroid positions for each cell.

### 2. What data encodings (geometric primitives and visual channels) are you using to visualize these data types?
I am using the geometric primitive of points to represent each cell. To encode expression counts of CD3D gene I am using the visual channel of color, and size for PRF1 gene. For variables "aligned_x" and "aligned_y", I am using the visual channel of position along the x axis and y axis, respectively

### 3. What about the data are you trying to make salient through this data visualization? 
My data visualization seeks to make more salient the location of T cells within the tissue slide, which are immune cells positive for CD3D expression. On top of that I want to highlight cytotoxic cells bearing a high PRF1 expression.

### 4. What Gestalt principles or knowledge about perceptiveness of visual encodings are you using to accomplish this?
My plot is using the similarity principle

### 5. Code 
```r
# Import libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

# Read data
file <- '/Users/kmlanderos/Documents/Johns_Hopkins/Spring_2025/Genomic_Data_Visualization/genomic-data-visualization-2025/data/pikachu.csv.gz'
data <- read.csv(file, row.names=1)

# Number of cells
nrow(data)
# Number of genes
ncol(data[,6:ncol(data)])

# Create plot
data %>% arrange(CD3D) %>% mutate(cell_area=log2(cell_area), CD8_CD4_ratio=CD8A/CD4) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=aligned_x, y=aligned_y, col=CD3D)) + 
    scale_colour_gradient(low = 'lightgrey', high='#2810fe') + 
    #geom_point(size = 1) +
    geom_point(aes(size = PRF1)) + 
    scale_size_continuous(range = c(0.2, 2)) + 
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(
      title = "Scatter plot highlighting spatial location of T cells and cytotoxic cells",
      x = "X coordinate",
      y = "Y coordinate",
      size = "PRF1 Expression",
      color = "CD3D Expression",
      shape = "CD4+/CD8+ T cell"
    )
```
