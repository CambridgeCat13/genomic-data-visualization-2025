Based on my clustering analysis and differential expression testing, I identified GPD1 (Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase 1) as the most upregulated gene in Cluster 5, distinguishing it from all other clusters. The visualizations strongly suggest that this cluster represents a metabolically distinct population within the breast tissue sample. Panel A displays the tSNE space, with cluster 5 highlighted in yellow, indicating its separation from other clusters. Panel B maps these cells onto the physical space of the tissue, showing that they are concentrated in a specific region. Panel C, the volcano plot, reveals that GPD1 is one of the most highly upregulated genes in this cluster, with significant logâ‚‚ fold-change and statistical significance. Panels D and E demonstrate that GPD1 expression is enriched in cluster 5 in both reduced-dimensional (tSNE) and spatial coordinates. The strong upregulation of GPD1, along with other genes like ADIPOQ (Adiponectin) and FABP4 (Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4), suggests that cluster 5 consists of adipocyte-like or lipid-metabolizing cells. These genes are known markers of adipocytes, which are specialized cells responsible for fat storage and play key roles in metabolism and signaling within breast tissue.

Recent studies suggest that GPD1 functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, influencing lipid metabolism through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Xia et al., 2023). GPD1 overexpression has been shown to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and higher levels of this gene correlate with better survival rates in breast cancer patients. Additionally, ADIPOQ, another gene highly expressed in this cluster, has been shown to induce autophagy-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells by activating the STK11/LKB1-AMPK-ULK1 pathway, ultimately suppressing tumor growth (Chung et al., 2017). This suggests that cluster 5 may represent a population of adipocytes or lipid-associated stromal cells that could help suppress breast cancer progression. Adipocytes are known to interact with breast cancer cells, influencing tumor behavior through metabolic and inflammatory signaling (Sierra et al., 2011). While adipocytes have been linked to both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing effects, the high expression of GPD1 and ADIPOQ in this cluster suggests that these cells may play a protective role in the tumor microenvironment by regulating lipid metabolism and promoting anti-cancer pathways.
