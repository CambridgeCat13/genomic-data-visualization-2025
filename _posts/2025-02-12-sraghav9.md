**Visualization Summary**
In this visualization, I am analyzing the Eevee sequencing spatial transcriptomics dataset. The 1000 most highly expressed genes were normalized, log-transformed, and clustered (K = 10). To understand gene expression similarity profiles and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, principal component analysis was performed (A). Cluster 4 was chosen and was spatially analyzed (B). Next, differential gene expression analysis was performed to display the statistical significant of changes in gene expression between cluster 4 and other clusters which ultimately highlights genes with large expression differences (C). The top 20 genes in cluster 4 were then displayed, and **MMP11** was chosen as the gene of interest due to its expression level (D). t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) analysis was then performed on MMP11 gene expression to better visualize its expression across cells (E), and spatial analysis was also performed (F).

Cluster 4 has biological meaning since many of the genes expressed are related to cell growth and migration and cancer progression. Specifically, MMP11 has been previously associated with breast cancer cell migration [1]. IGFBP7 has also been previously shown to have both pro- and anti-angiogenic properties in different tissue remodeling states which can influence tumor growth [2]. As such, I am interpreting my cell cluster as cancer-causing or full-blown cancer cells. Although, I would need to confirm this theory with the content of the other clusters to get a full understanding.
