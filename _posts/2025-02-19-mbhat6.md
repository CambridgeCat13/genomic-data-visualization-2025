This figure presents an analysis of cellular clusters within the Eevee dataset, focusing on the identification and characterization of a biologically relevant cluster using k-means clustering, dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA and t-SNE), differential gene expression analysis, and statistical analysis through volcano plots. The goal is to determine whether the identified cluster corresponds to the epithelial-like population previously characterized in the Pikachu dataset of HW3, despite differences in the dataset resolution and clustering structure. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression dataset, improving clustering performance by filtering noise. K-means clustering was then performed on the top principal components to obtain the optimal number of clusters. The top-left PCA plot and top-middle t-SNE plot visualize these clusters, with the cluster of interest highlighted in purple, distinguishing it from the remaining cells (highlighted in green). The top-right physical space plot further confirms that this cluster exhibits a distinct spatial organization within the tissue sample. Furthermore, to identify the optimal PCs needed to account for meaningful variance of the Eevee dataset, visual comparisons were completed to change the number of optimal PCs from 20 in the Pikachu code to 7. In addition to this, the elbow method was additionally utilized to identify the optimal number of clusters (k) for the data. Through identifying the elbow point, the optimal number of clusters was changed from the previous value of 5 to 6. This allowed for the optimal number of clusters for the Eevee dataset. Finally, the presence of the top 2 highly expressed genes from HW3, KRT5 and KRT17, was tested within each cluster of the Eevee dataset to determine that the new cluster of interest would be Cluster 1 (rather than Cluster 2) in order to identify the adequate cell type cluster of epithelial cells with keratinization characteristics.

To assess the biological relevance of this cluster, differentially expressed genes were identified using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, followed by visualization in the volcano plot (bottom panel). This analysis revealed a set of significantly upregulated genes—KRT17, KRT6B, LAMC2, LAMB3, ACTG2, and KLK5—that distinguish this cluster. Compared to the Pikachu dataset, where epithelial markers such as KRT5, KRT15, KRT16, ELF3, and CEACAM8 were dominant, the Eevee dataset highlights a shift in gene expression patterns, reflecting potential differences in dataset resolution and biological context. However, through further analysis with the Human Protein Atlas, each of these upregulated genes has well-documented associations with epithelial differentiation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and, in some cases, tumorigenesis. KRT17 (Keratin 17), KRT6B (Keratin 6B), LAMC2 (Laminin Subunit Gamma-2), LAMB3 (Laminin Subunit Beta-3), KLK5 (Kallikrein-Related Peptidase 5), and COL17A1 (Collagen type XVII alpha 1 chain) are all shown to exhibit the same squamous epithelial cell line expression that is specific to keratinization, while ACTG2 is found to be expressed in connective tissue cell lines with ECM organization. With this result, it is therefore clear this code identifies the same epithelial cell cluster with tumorigenic characteristics that was previously identified within the Pikachu dataset.

To further confirm the biological identity of the cluster, KRT17 expression levels were mapped in PCA space (middle-left), t-SNE space (middle-center), and physical space (middle-right). The strong enrichment of KRT17 within the cluster supports its epithelial-like properties and potential stress-induced transformation. As well as this, the observed upregulation of basement membrane-associated genes (LAMC2, LAMB3), cytoskeletal regulators (ACTG2), and proteases (KLK5) further indicates a highly dynamic and possibly invasive epithelial population. By adapting the analytical workflow from HW3, I successfully identified an epithelial-like cluster in the Eevee dataset, corresponding to the previously analyzed cluster in the Pikachu dataset. The observed shift from KRT5/KRT15-based markers in Pikachu to KRT17/KRT6B/LAMC2 in Eevee suggests dataset-specific variability with the dramatic increase in genes represented while maintaining epithelial characteristics. The integration of clustering, spatial mapping, and differential gene expression analysis strongly supports the presence of epithelial-enriched features within this cluster. Furthermore, the upregulated genes' known involvement in tumorigenesis, EMT, and ECM remodeling (validated through HPA and literature sources) provides strong biological justification for the classification of this cluster.
