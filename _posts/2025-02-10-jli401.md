### 1. Describe your figure briefly so we know what you are depicting. Write a description to convince me that your cluster interpretation is correct. 

#### Figure Description and Interpretation
This figure presents a multi-dimensional analysis of Cluster 10, a cell group identified via k-means clustering (k = 10) of single-cell gene expression data. The panels are organized into four rows that together demonstrate both the distinct spatial distribution and unique gene expression profile of Cluster 10.

tSNE Space (Row 1) Plot A: A tSNE map displays Cluster 10 highlighted in plum pink against a gray background representing other clusters. The clear separation of Cluster 10 in this nonlinear projection suggests that these cells form a unique population. Plot B: Overlaying the expression of ELF3 (a key transcription factor) on the tSNE space using a gradient from gray (low) to blueviolet (high) reveals that cells in Cluster 10 express ELF3 at significantly higher levels compared to surrounding clusters.

PCA Space (Row 2) Plot C: A PCA plot similarly emphasizes the segregation of Cluster 10 in a linear dimensionality reduction framework, corroborating the distinctiveness observed in the tSNE analysis. Plot D: Mapping ELF3 expression onto the PCA space reinforces that high ELF3 expression aligns with the cells in Cluster 10, supporting the marker’s role in defining this cluster.

Physical Tissue Space (Row 3) Plot E: The spatial visualization of cells on the tissue section shows that Cluster 10 occupies a defined region, suggesting that these cells are not only transcriptionally distinct but also localized within specific tissue microenvironments. Plot F: The spatial distribution of ELF3 expression mirrors that of Cluster 10, further indicating that ELF3 is a hallmark of the cells’ identity in this cluster.

Differential Expression (Volcano Plot, Row 4) Plot G: A volcano plot displays differentially expressed genes in Cluster 10 compared to all other clusters. The gene ELF3 is highlighted as a significantly upregulated gene in Cluster 10, along with KRT16 and KRT5. Downregulated genes such as PTGDS and MRC1 are also labeled. Based on the volcano plot, ELF3 was chosen as a marker gene for Cluster 10 due to its significant upregulation and potential biological relevance. The expression of ELF3 is further visualized in tSNE, PCA, and physical space to confirm its association with Cluster 10.

#### Supporting Evidence and Biological Context
The high expression of ELF3 in Cluster 10 is significant for our interpretation. ELF3 (E74-like factor 3) is an epithelial-specific transcription factor known to regulate genes involved in epithelial differentiation, cell adhesion, and maintenance of tissue architecture. Its role in promoting epithelial cell identity has been well documented. For instance: 
Otero et al. (2009) demonstrated that ELF3 is crucial for maintaining epithelial differentiation and that its dysregulation can contribute to cancer progression by affecting cell adhesion and migration.
Sengez et al. (2019) provided evidence that ELF3 helps suppress the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), further supporting its role as a guardian of epithelial characteristics.
According to The Human Protein Atlas, ELF3 exhibits high RNA expression in respiratory epithelial cells, which aligns with our findings that Cluster 10 represents an epithelial cell population (The Human Protein Atlas, 2023).
The co-expression of keratin genes (e.g., KRT16 and KRT5) along with ELF3 in Cluster 10 lends additional support to an epithelial cell identity. Keratins are well-established markers of epithelial cells, and their upregulation is consistent with the transcriptional profile expected from differentiated epithelial populations (Chilosi et al., 2002).

Conclusion: The integration of dimensionality reduction (tSNE and PCA), spatial mapping, and differential expression analyses in the figure robustly indicates that Cluster 10 represents a distinct epithelial cell population. The high expression of ELF3—supported by its documented role in epithelial differentiation and maintenance—along with other epithelial markers, substantiates this interpretation. The association of ELF3 with respiratory epithelial cells, as reported by The Human Protein Atlas, further strengthens the epithelial identity of Cluster 10. To further verify the physical location of Cluster 10, it would be beneficial to explore breast tissue cross-section scans available online, which I currently lack and will need to investigate further.
