description: "Hi everyone! My name is Meera Bhat, and I am a BME senior and master's student. I am excited to join this class and learn more about genomic data visualization as I have been working in Dr. Rong Fan's lab at Yale University on spatial omics sequencing and transcriptomics with senescent tissues and would love to learn more. In my free time, I love to read, paint my nails, cook, and dance!"
