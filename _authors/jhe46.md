description: "Hello, this is Harriet! I’m a first-year BME master's student. Above are my friend’s cat (a Ragdoll on the left) and my cat, Ananas (a Maine Coon on the right). Ananas means 'pineapple' in French—he’s an 18lb cat who loves to eat and sleep. I am currently conducting bioinformatics and spatial transcriptomics research in both the Adamo Lab and Umapathi Lab, focusing on Myocarditis and OGT/OGA."
